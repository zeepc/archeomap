# ArcheoMap

Many people love going to museums and learning more about the places and the cultures where some of the most world famous artifacts have been found. 

Unfortunatly, many people are not familiar with the geography of the ancient world. To provide a better experience to vistors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Ancient Near East galleries, ArcheoMap shows the locations of those ancient cities, and the artifacts associated with those places.

**This project is still in development.**
