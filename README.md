# ArcheoMap

Walking around a museum with ancient artifacts awakens the imagination of children and adults alike. We all imagine ourselves in places like Babylon or Memphis, leading major archeological expeditions to find hidden treasures. But many are not familiar with the geography of the ancient world. Many city names have changed over time. But we can still make a connection with those places today!

To provide a better experience to vistors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Ancient Near East galleries, ArcheoMap shows the locations of those ancient cities, and the artifacts associated with those locations. 


**This project is still in development.**
